# Grayson's metrics and analysis

I've been keeping track of a number of metrics in my life for about a year now (258 days). It started after reading *Climb Strong* by Steve Betchel who mentioned that in order to improve you need an objective and therefore a metric to measure improvement. As part of this I started to do track a number of metrics while climbing but also started tracking other metrics in my life with the intent of improving by looking at data.

The goal of measuring a number of factors was sucessful; meaningful information on what helped me improve was not successful.
